# Price_Negotiation_chatbot_API ü§ùüí¨
An intelligent negotiation chatbot API built with FastAPI, leveraging Hugging Face for natural language generation and NLTK's VADER for sentiment analysis. This API allows users to negotiate product prices in real-time while dynamically generating counteroffers and analyzing sentiment for a human-like interaction.

## API Endpoints
1. Start Negotiation

 - Endpoint:POST /start-negotiation
 - Request:
   ```json
   {
      "user_id": "123"
   }

 - Response:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Welcome! Let's negotiate the price for the Premium Laptop. The starting price is $1000.0.",
     "current_price": 1000.0,
     "status": "ongoing"
   }
2. Make Offer
 - Endpoint: POST /offer
 - Request:
   ```json
   {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "offer": 800
   }
 - Response:
   ```json
   {
    "message": "How about we settle at $850.0 for the Premium Laptop?",
    "current_price": 850.0,
    "status": "ongoing"

   }
   
   
  
4. Get Current Price
 - Endpoint: GET /current-price
 - Query Parameter: user_id=123
   ```json
   {
   "product": "Premium Laptop",
   "current_price": 850.0,
   "status": "ongoing"
   }

5. Sentiment Analysis
 - Endpoint: POST /sentiment-analysis  
 - Request:
   ```json
   {
   "text": "I think this is a fair price."
   }

 - Response:
   ```json
   {
   "neg": 0.0,
   "neu": 0.544,
   "pos": 0.456,
   "compound": 0.6369
   }

## Configuration

Key configurations for negotiation are defined in the source code:

- PRODUCT: Name of the product (default: Premium Laptop).
- INITIAL_PRICE: Starting price of the product (default: 1000.0 USD).
- MIN_PRICE: Minimum acceptable price (default: 700.0 USD).
- MAX_PRICE: Maximum price (default: 1200.0 USD).
- PRICE_STEP: Counteroffer increment/decrement value (default: 50.0 USD).

## How It Works

1.Session Management:
   Each negotiation session is stored in-memory using a sessions dictionary.
   A unique user_id is required to start a session.

2.Pricing Logic:
   If a user‚Äôs offer is greater than or equal to the current price, the negotiation is accepted.
   If an offer is below the minimum price, it‚Äôs rejected.
   For other offers, a counteroffer is generated.

3.Counteroffer Generation:
   GPT-2 model from Hugging Face API generates personalized responses based on user input.

4.Sentiment Analysis:
   User input is analyzed using VADER to determine sentiment (negative, neutral, positive).
