# Price_Negotiation_chatbot_API ü§ùüí¨
An intelligent negotiation chatbot API built with FastAPI, leveraging Hugging Face for natural language generation and NLTK's VADER for sentiment analysis. This API allows users to negotiate product prices in real-time while dynamically generating counteroffers and analyzing sentiment for a human-like interaction.

# How It Works

    1.Session Management:
        Each negotiation session is stored in-memory using a sessions dictionary.
        A unique user_id is required to start a session.

    2.Pricing Logic:
        If a user‚Äôs offer is greater than or equal to the current price, the negotiation is accepted.
        If an offer is below the minimum price, it‚Äôs rejected.
        For other offers, a counteroffer is generated.

    3.Counteroffer Generation:
        GPT-2 model from Hugging Face API generates personalized responses based on user input.

    4.Sentiment Analysis:
        User input is analyzed using VADER to determine sentiment (negative, neutral, positive).
